# 1970.one _ The Origin of Time

> **"Time is the only true unit of measure."**

**1970.one** is a minimalist, cyberpunk-styled dashboard that pays homage to the Unix Epoch. It visualizes the flow of "digital time" through real-time global event streams.

### Live Streams
It captures the heartbeat of the internet across three dimensions:
- **Knowledge:** Wikipedia Recent Changes (The flow of information)
- **Value:** Bitcoin Mempool Transactions (The flow of money)
- **Code:** GitHub Event Stream (The flow of creation)

### Features
- **Precision Clock:** Local, UTC, and raw Unix Timestamp display.
- **Y2K38 Countdown:** Calculating the remaining time until the 32-bit integer overflow.
- **Terminal UI:** A retro-futuristic CLI interface with distinct themes for each stream.
- **No-Backend:** Built entirely with Vanilla JS, utilizing EventSource and WebSockets.
